It combines several state-of-the-art optimization tools, allowing you to create mRNA constructs with optimized coding sequences (CDS) and appropriate untranslated regions (UTRs).\n","\n","### Do I need coding experience to use VaxLab?\n","No! VaxLab is designed to be user-friendly for researchers without programming experience. The notebook interface guides you through each step with clear instructions.\n","\n","### How long does the optimization process take?\n","Typically 3-5 minutes for average-sized proteins (300-500 amino acids). Larger sequences may take longer, especially with LinearDesign or CUSTOM.\n","\n","## üß¨ Input Sequences\n","### What format should my protein sequence be in?\n","Enter your protein sequence in single-letter amino acid code (e.g., MAVRGHPGKGASCTL...) without spaces or special characters.\n","\n","### Can I input a DNA sequence instead of a protein?\n","Yes. Please enter a DNA or RNA CDS sequence directly, which will be translated automatically.\n","\n","### What sequence length can VaxLab handle?\n","VaxLab works best with sequences between 50-1000 amino acids. Very long sequences (>1000 amino acids) may cause longer computation times or occasional timeouts in the Colab environment. \\\n","Optimizing a sequence longer than 600 amino acids with LinearDesign might fail on the free version of Google Colab due to insufficient RAM. In such cases, you can either use a different CDS optimization tool besides LinearDesign, or you will need to subscribe to a paid version of Google Colab.\n","\n","### Do I need to add a stop codon to my sequence?\n","No, VaxLab automatically adds stop codons (UGAUAAUAG) to the end of your coding sequence.\n","\n","## üõ†Ô∏è Optimization Tools\n","### Which optimization tool should I choose?\n","\n","- **LinearDesign**: Best for most applications, balancing structure and codon optimization\n","- **CodonBERT**: Useful when maximum expression is the primary goal\n","- **Simple Codon Optimizer**: Good for basic applications or when you want minimal structural manipulation\n","- **CUSTOM**: Best when tissue-specific expression is important\n","\n","### What does the LinearDesign Œª value control?\n","The Œª parameter (0-10) balances the importance of codon optimization versus mRNA structure optimization:\n","\n","- Œª = 0: Focuses entirely on optimizing mRNA structure\n","- Œª = 10: Focuses entirely on codon adaptation\n","- Œª = 4 (default): Balanced approach suitable for most applications\n","\n","### What tissues can I target with the CUSTOM optimizer?\n","The CUSTOM optimizer supports 36 different human tissues, including lung, heart, liver, muscle, brain, and various immune system components. Select the tissue where your mRNA vaccine will be primarily expressed.\n","\n","## üß© UTRs and Structure\n","###Which UTRs should I choose for my vaccine design?\n","For vaccine applications, we recommend starting with the BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2) UTRs, which have proven successful in commercial vaccines. The Moderna (mRNA-1273) UTRs are also well-validated options.\n","\n","### What is MRL in the Optimus-5-Prime settings?\n","MRL (Mean Ribosome Load) is a measure of translation efficiency. Higher values (5.5-7.5) create UTRs that promote higher protein expression, while lower values (1.5-3.5) create UTRs with more moderate translation rates.\n","\n","### What is a good MFE (minimum free energy) value?\n","MFE is measured in kcal/mol, with more negative values indicating more stable structures:\n","\n","- -200 to -300 kcal/mol: Typical for medium-sized constructs with moderate structure\n","- < -400 kcal/mol: Highly structured mRNA (may impede translation)\n","- -150 kcal/mol: Low structure stability (may be prone to degradation)\n","\n","The optimal MFE depends on your sequence length and design goals.\n","\n","## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting\n","### The optimization process is taking too long\n","For lengthy sequences or when using LinearDesign, the process can take 10+ minutes. If it exceeds 20 minutes, try:\n","\n","1. Restarting the runtime\n","2. Using a simpler optimization tool (Simple Codon Optimizer or CodonBERT)\n","\n","### I'm getting an error during installation\n","Common installation issues can be resolved by:\n","\n","1. Restarting the runtime and running all cells again\n","2. Ensuring you have a stable internet connection\n","\n","### The structure visualization isn't loading\n","Try:\n","\n","1. Rerunning just the visualization cell\n","2. Ensuring you have a stable internet connection\n","3. If persistent, download the report file which contains another visualization\n","\n","### The interactive editor isn't loading\n","Try:\n","\n","1. Rerunning just the editor cell\n","2. Ensuring you have a stable internet connection\n","3. If you've been running VaxLab many times, please clear your Chrome cookies and try again\n","\n","### How can I save my results?\n","Your report file is automatically saved.\n","\n","1. The optimized sequence can be saved from the interactive editor (`File` - `Export Sequence`)\n","2. A comprehensive report is generated and downloaded automatically\n","3. You can also manually copy sequences from the interactive editor\n","\n","## üîç Interpretation and Next Steps\n","### How do I interpret the optimization reports?\n","The report provides several key metrics:\n","\n","- CAI (Codon Adaptation Index): Higher values (closer to 1.0) indicate better codon usage\n","- GC content: Ideally between 40-60% for most applications\n","- MFE (Minimum Free Energy): Indicates structure stability\n","- Loop metrics: Longer loops may indicate more accessible regions for translation\n","\n","### What should I do after designing my mRNA sequence?\n","Typical next steps include:\n","\n","1. Synthesizing the designed sequence (through commercial providers)\n","2. Performing in vitro transcription to produce the mRNA\n","3. Testing expression levels in cell culture\n","4. Evaluating immunogenicity in model systems\n","\n","### Can I compare multiple design strategies?\n","Yes! We recommend:\n","\n","1. Creating several designs with different optimization tools\n","2. Keeping the same UTRs while varying the CDS optimization\n","3. Comparing the resulting metrics and structures\n","4. Testing the most promising candidates experimentally\n","\n","### Is VaxLab suitable for therapeutic mRNAs beyond vaccines?\n","Absolutely. While developed with vaccines in mind, VaxLab's optimization strategies are equally applicable to therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and other mRNA-based therapeutics."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
